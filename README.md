lightbox
========
[Lightbox installation](http://www.ericcorriel.com/art/lightbox) is a site-specific light installation that uses light to create a three dimensional form in space.

This piece started as a challenge: could I create a floating cube in the middle of a room? Could I create a "light helmet" that would enclose the viewer's head in a virtual box of made of light?
